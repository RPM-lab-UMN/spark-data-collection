# Python Environment Setup

This is a setup page for any account that needs its own repo-local `.venv`.

Use it when you are:

- provisioning the shared collection account
- setting up your own Linux account on the existing collection machine
- repairing or recreating the repo-local `.venv`
- setting up a maintainer account that needs to run conversion or the operator console directly

Normal operators on the already-prepared lab machine should not need to do this during collection. If `collect` already works from `shared_account`, skip this page and continue with:

- [Hardware Bring-Up](./hardware-bringup.md)

This page explains the local Python environment used by the current pipeline.

The important idea is that we do **not** use one interpreter for everything.

Current split:

- system ROS Python:
  - `/usr/bin/python3`
- repo-local project environment:
  - `.venv`

## Why There Are Two Python Paths

The pipeline uses:

- ROS 2 Jazzy packages installed for system Python
- a repo-local `.venv` for project dependencies that are not provided by the
  ROS install

That means:

- some scripts are intentionally run with `/usr/bin/python3`
- other tools are intentionally run from `.venv`

This is not accidental. It is the current supported setup.

## What `.venv` Is Used For

The repo-local `.venv` is the main local project environment for:

- offline bag conversion and LeRobot export
- Teleop GUI/runtime dependencies such as `ur_rtde`
- SPARK serial runtime dependency `pyserial`
- the Qt operator console dependency `PySide6`
- local validation and calibration tools that run from `.venv`

The bootstrap script is:

- `./data_pipeline/setup_shared_venv.sh`

The script name stays `setup_shared_venv.sh`, but it prepares the repo-local
`.venv` used by more than just the converter.

## What System ROS Python Is Still Used For

System ROS Python remains the main path for:

- raw recording entrypoints launched as `/usr/bin/python3`
- the GelSight bridge
- the RealSense capture bridge
- the pinned local `librealsense v2.54.2` runtime build

The most important consequence is:

- the RealSense capture path does **not** use `.venv` as its primary runtime
- it uses `/usr/bin/python3` plus the local pinned `v2.54.2` build wired in by
  `setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh`

## Create The Repo-Local `.venv`

From the main repo root:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
./data_pipeline/setup_shared_venv.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

What that script installs:

- `requirements-converter.txt`
- `requirements-teleop.txt`
- `requirements-operator-console.txt`
- `torch==2.6.0`
- `torchvision==0.21.0`
- editable `lerobot` from the sibling workspace checkout

That includes the Qt operator console dependency:

- `PySide6`

## Finish The One-Time Project Bootstrap

The remaining one-time bootstrap step is the pinned RealSense runtime setup.

From the main repo root:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
./data_pipeline/setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh
```

This prepares the local pinned `librealsense v2.54.2` runtime used by the
current RealSense capture path.

Any account can run the repo-owned launcher directly:

```bash
~/spark-workspace/spark-data-collection/collect
```

If you want the short command name `collect`, expose that repo-owned launcher
on `PATH` after the environment is ready:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -sfn ~/spark-workspace/spark-data-collection/collect ~/bin/collect
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Why ROS Still Needs To Be Sourced

Even inside `.venv`, the ROS environment must still be sourced before running
tools that depend on ROS Python modules such as:

- `rclpy`
- `rosbag2_py`

So for `.venv` tools that touch ROS, use:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

not just:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Practical Checks

After setup, these commands should succeed:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python - <<'PY'
import lerobot
import torch
import rtde_control
import rtde_receive
import serial
print("repo-local .venv imports look good")
PY
```

The Qt operator console import check should also work:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python - <<'PY'
import PySide6
print("PySide6 import OK")
PY
```

## Current Limitations

This repo-local `.venv` intentionally does **not** yet encode every optional input
device dependency.

Examples that are still outside the core setup path:

- `pyspacemouse`
- VR/OpenVR-specific Python dependencies

Those should be documented separately once their setup path is tightened.

## Next Step

After the Python environment is ready, move on to:

- [Viewer Setup](./viewer-setup.md) if this account needs local dataset viewing
- [Personal Account Setup](./personal-account-setup.md) if you are following the personal-account path
- [Lab Machine Quick Start](./lab-machine-quick-start.md) if you are preparing the shared account
